# 🚀 JourneyforAI

Welcome to my learning journey into the world of **Artificial Intelligence** 🤖.  
This project contains my personal study notes, practice code, and experiments as I learn the mathematical and programming foundations of AI.

## 📘 What I’m Learning:

- ✅ Linear Algebra basics (Vectors, Matrices)
- ✅ Matrix operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication)
- ✅ Scalar and Dot Products
- ✅ Transpose and Inverse
- ✅ LU Decomposition
- ✅ QR Decomposition
- ✅ Solving linear equations with NumPy (`np.linalg.solve`)
- ✅ Python and NumPy for matrix math
